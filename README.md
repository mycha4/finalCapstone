Capstone Project - task management system.  

This is a simple task management system with user authentication. It allows users to register, log in, add tasks, view all tasks, view their own tasks, display statistics (only accessible to the admin), and exit the program.

Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

1. Registration (Option 'r'): Allows users to register by providing a new username and password. The password is confirmed to ensure accuracy.

2. Adding a Task (Option 'a'): Users can add tasks by providing details such as the username of the person the task is assigned to, task title, description, and due date. The task is then added to the task list.

3. View All Tasks (Option 'va'): Displays all tasks stored in the system, including details like task title, assigned user, due date, and description.

4. View My Tasks (Option 'vm'): Displays tasks assigned to the currently logged-in user.

5. Display Statistics (Option 'ds'): Displays statistics such as the number of users and the number of tasks. This option is only available to the admin user.

6. Exit (Option 'e'): Allows the user to exit the program.
